Basic DXM Connection Example

This example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of connecting to a
Banner DXM controller and reading sensor data via Modbus TCP.

Educational Focus:
- Basic Modbus TCP connection establishment
- Simple sensor data reading
- Error handling patterns
- Connection lifecycle management

Prerequisites:
- DXM controller accessible at 192.168.0.1 (or modify IP)
- At least one IO-Link radar sensor connected to the DXM
- Network connectivity from this computer to the DXM

Run this example:
    python basic_connection.py
